### Code Quality

Make sure that the code you write
- is tested and bug free
- is [Secure by Default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_default)
- maintains the ease of use

### Commits
Remember to **sign** each of your commits as PRs with large amounts of unverified commits will not be approved.
Ideally all your commits should be signed in a PR. If you don't have a GPG key attached to your Github account,
please create one, add it to your account and use it to sign your commits.
