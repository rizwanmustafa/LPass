1. Create a new virtual environment in a folder called 'venv' for this project (This will prevent your binary size and compilation time from being too long).
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package
```bash
pip install .
```

4. Start LPass
```bash
lpass
```


Bonus - If you want to do it all in one step:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install .
lpass
```
